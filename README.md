This is a repository used to demo how to extend Python with C++ code. 

The code only works under Linux OS. I was using Debian 12

To compile the C++ package as HelloModule, run `python setup.py build`. `HelloModule.so` will be generated in build folder. Then you can test the module with main.py

There is only 1 class called Hello in HelloModule.
